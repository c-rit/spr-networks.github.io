(Effective as of 1/1/2024, Updated 1/1/2024)

Welcome to Supernetworks, an open source router project (SPR), PLUS (the Service), and website (http://www.supernetworks.org,) operated by Supernetworks, Inc. (the “Company”).

Using SPR, you can build a more secure wifi and vpn network complete with plugins and extensions. We also offer PLUS (the Service), a subscription service to support the project that adds access to advanced firewall features.

The following Terms of Use (“Terms”) apply when you use SPR, the website, and the Service.

Please review these Terms carefully.  By accessing or using SPR or the Service, or by installing SPR, you show you agree to these Terms.  If you don’t agree to these Terms, you may not access the website or use the Service.

ABOUT SPR AND THE SERVICE

You will be charged for access to the Service based on the plan you pick when you sign up for SPR, or via an in-App purchase.

You will be required to provide the Company or its billing service provider with information regarding your credit card or other payment methods. You represent and warrant to the Company that such information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment method. You will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date).

You hereby authorize the Company or its billing service provider to bill you in advance (on a lifetime or periodic basis, if this is applicable to the plan you pick)  in accordance with the terms of your plan until you terminate your account, and you agree to pay any charges incurred. If you dispute any charges you must notify the Company within thirty (30) days after the date that you are billed.

The term of the Subscription Service will continue on the date of purchase of the applicable Product (or the date you purchase a renewed subscription) and continue for the applicable term purchased. Company will have the right to terminate the Subscription Service prior to expiration of the applicable term by providing you notice, provided that if you purchased a term by paying in advance (e.g. a $0 Subscription or 12-month Subscription), then upon any termination Company will refund to you a pro-rata portion of the payment you made for the term of the Subscription Services (the $0 Subscription will be deemed a 30-month term for refund purpose). By way of example, if you paid $60 for a 12-month term, and Company terminates the term after 6 months, then Company would refund $30. There is no refund offered for lifetime service bundled with the Product. These refunds only apply to Products and Services purchased directly from the Company; for purchases from any other source, please contact the seller, which may have a different policy. The company is not responsible for any refunds for Products or Services obtained other than directly from the Company.

Information about our current fees is here.  We reserve the right to change the Company’s fees. If the Company does change its fees, the Company will provide notice of the change in email to you, at Company’s option, at least 14 days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Service after the fee change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount.

We may terminate your access to the Service for any reason, at our sole discretion

You can terminate your use of the Service at any time.

SPR and the Service are under constant development. New features may be added frequently, so it’s important to check back to this page for updates.
